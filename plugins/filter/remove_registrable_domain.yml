  version_added: 0.1.0
  description:
    - Removes the registrable domain name from a DNS name.
  options:
    _input:
      description:
        - A DNS name.
      type: string
      required: true
    keep_trailing_period:
      description:
        - This controls whether the trailing period of the prefix (that is, the part before the
          registrable domain) is preserved or not.
      type: boolean
      default: false
    keep_unknown_suffix:
      description:
        - This treats unknown TLDs as valid public suffixes. So for example the public suffix of
          C(example.tlddoesnotexist) is C(.tlddoesnotexist) if this is C(true), and hence the
          registrable domain of C(www.example.tlddoesnotexist) is C(example.tlddoesnotexist).
          If set to C(false), the registrable domain of C(www.example.tlddoesnotexist) is
          C(tlddoesnotexist).
        - This option corresponds to whether the global wildcard rule C(*) in the Public Suffix List
          is used or not.
      type: boolean
      default: true
    only_if_registerable:
      description:
        - This controls the behavior in case there is no label in front of the public suffix.
          This is the case if the DNS name itself is a public suffix.
        - If set to C(false), in this case the public suffix is treated as a registrable domain.
        - If set to C(true) (default), the registrable domain of a public suffix is interpreted as an
          empty string.
      type: boolean
      default: true
    icann_only:
      description:
        - This controls whether only entries from the ICANN section of the Public Suffix List are used,
          or also entries from the Private section. For example, C(.co.uk) is in the ICANN section,
          but C(github.io) is in the Private section.
      type: boolean
      default: false
