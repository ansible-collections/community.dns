        description:
          - Describes whether to fetch a single record and type combination, all types for a
            record, or all records. By default, a single record and type combination is fetched.
          - Note that the return value structure depends on this option.

        description:
          - The full DNS record to retrieve.
          - If O(what) is V(single_record) or V(all_types_for_record), exactly one of O(record) and O(prefix) is required.

    prefix:
        description:
          - The prefix of the DNS record.
          - This is the part of O(record) before O(zone_name). For example, if the record to be modified is C(www.example.com)
            for the zone C(example.com), the prefix is V(www). If the record in this example would be C(example.com), the
            prefix would be V('') (empty string).
          - If O(what) is V(single_record) or V(all_types_for_record), exactly one of O(record) and O(prefix) is required.
