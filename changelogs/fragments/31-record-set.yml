breaking_changes:
- "The hosttech_dns_record module has been renamed to hosttech_dns_record_set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31)."
- "hosttech_dns_record_set - the option ``overwrite`` was replaced by a new option ``on_existing``.
   Specifying ``overwrite=true`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=replace`` (the new default).
   Specifying ``overwrite=false`` with ``state=present`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=keep_and_fail``,
   and specifying ``overwrite=false`` with ``state=absent`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=keep``
   (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31)."
