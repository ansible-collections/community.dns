  ...
major_changes:
  - The ``community.dns`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``
    collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality
    for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections
    are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the
    collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed
    automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection
    to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git
    repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency
    if you are using the inventory plugins
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196).
breaking_changes:
  - "The default for the ``txt_character_encoding`` options in various modules and plugins changed from ``octal`` to ``decimal``

  - "inventory plugins - the ``plugin`` option is now required (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196).
  - "inventory plugins - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``, but a new, different option
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196).
removed_features:
  - "hetzner_dns_record_set, hetzner_dns_record - the deprecated alias ``name`` of the prefix option was removed
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196)."
minor_changes:

     hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/196)."
