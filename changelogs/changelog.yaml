  2.0.0-a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Hosttech API creation - now requires a ``ModuleOptionProvider`` object instead
        of an ``AnsibleModule`` object. Alternatively an Ansible plugin instance can
        be passed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/37).
      - The hosttech_dns_record module has been renamed to hosttech_dns_record_set
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      - When using the internal modules API, now a zone ID type and a provider information
        object must be passed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/27).
      - hosttech_dns_record_set - the option ``overwrite`` was replaced by a new option
        ``on_existing``. Specifying ``overwrite=true`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=replace``
        (the new default). Specifying ``overwrite=false`` with ``state=present`` is
        equivalent to ``on_existing=keep_and_fail``, and specifying ``overwrite=false``
        with ``state=absent`` is equivalent to ``on_existing=keep`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      deprecated_features:
      - The hosttech_dns_records module has been renamed to hosttech_dns_record_sets.
        The old name will stop working in community.dns 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      minor_changes:
      - Add support for Hetzner DNS (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/27).
      - The hosttech_dns_records module has been renamed to hosttech_dns_record_sets
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      - The internal API now supports bulk DNS record changes, if supported by the
        API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/39).
      - Use HTTP helper class to make API implementations work for both plugins and
        modules. Make WSDL API use ``fetch_url`` instead of ``open_url`` for modules
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/36).
      - hosttech_dns_* modules - rename ``zone`` parameter to ``zone_name``. The old
        name ``zone`` can still be used as an alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/32).
      - hosttech_dns_record_set - ``value`` is no longer required when ``state=absent``
        and ``overwrite=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      - hosttech_dns_record_sets - ``records`` has been renamed to ``record_sets``.
        The old name ``records`` can still be used as an alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/31).
      - hosttech_dns_zone_info - return extra information as ``zone_info`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/38).

  2.0.0-a2:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - All Hetzner modules and plugins which handle DNS records now work with unquoted
        TXT values by default. The old behavior can be obtained by setting ``txt_transformation=api``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/issues/48, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/57,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/60).
      - The hetzner_dns_record_info and hosttech_dns_record_info modules have been
        renamed to hetzner_dns_record_set_info and hosttech_dns_record_set_info, respectively
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/54).
      - hetzner_dns_record* modules - implement correct handling of default TTL. The
        value ``none`` is now accepted and returned in this case (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/52,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/issues/50).
      - hetzner_dns_record, hetzner_dns_record_set, hetzner_dns_record_sets - the
        default TTL is now 300 and no longer 3600, which equals the default in the
        web console (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/43).
      bugfixes:
      - Hetzner API - interpret missing TTL as 300, which is what the web console
        also does (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/42).
      - Update Public Suffix List.
      - hetzner API code - make sure to also handle errors returned by the API if
        the HTTP status code indicates success. This sometimes happens for 500 Internal
        Server Error (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/58).
      - hosttech_dns_zone_info - make sure that full information is returned both
        when requesting a zone by ID or by name (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/56).
      minor_changes:
      - Added a ``txt_transformation`` option to all modules and plugins working with
        DNS records (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/issues/48,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/57, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/60).
      - hetzner_dns_zone_info - the ``legacy_ns`` return value is now sorted, since
        its order is unstable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/46).

  2.0.0-a3:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The internal bulk record updating helper (``bulk_apply_changes``) now also
        returns the records that were deleted, created or updated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
      - The internal record API no longer allows to manage comments explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
      bugfixes:
      - Update Public Suffix List.
      minor_changes:
      - The internal record API allows to manage extra data (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
      - hetzner_dns_record and hosttech_dns_record - when not using check mode, use
        actual return data for diff, instead of input data, so that extra data can
        be shown (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.dns/pull/63).
